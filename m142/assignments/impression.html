<h3>Impressionism</h3>
In this assignment, you will generate drawings in the style of impressionism through randomly placed smudges whose colors are determined by an image of your choosing.<br><br>

<b>Turning it:</b> To turn in this project, you should place the website in a folder called <b>impression</b> inside of your class website and link the site from your main class homepage.<br><br>

<b>Requirements:</b> <br><br>

The site should contain at least these pages:

	<ul>
	<li>(1 page) A home page with a title and links to the pages listed below. Each page below will include either a Spork canvas or an image that you have generated. To generate each of these images, you can use either the animation loop or a for loop. If you use an animation loop, and if you include the spork canvas on your page instead of an image, be sure to include buttons to Stop, Go, and Start Over</li>
	<li>(1 page) Select an image as a base image. I suggest you use an image without a lot of detail and with contrasting colors. Generate a drawing composed of randomly placed "smudges" whose colors are determined by your base image.</li>
	<li>(1 page) Using the same base image, generate a drawing composed of "smudges" placed on a regular grid whose colors are determined by your base image.</li>
	<li>(1 page) Select <b>another</b> image as a base image. I suggest you use an image without a lot of detail and with contrasting colors. Generate a drawing composed of randomly placed "smudges" whose colors are determined by your base image.</li>
	<li>(1 page) Using the same base image, generate a drawing composed of "smudges" placed on a regular grid whose colors are determined by your base image.</li>
	<li>(1 page) Generate a drawing composed of randomly placed "smudges" whose colors are determined randomly. You may want to use an array to limit the possible colors.</li>
	</ul>
<b>If you would rather, this assignment can be accomplished through a photo-gallery of images you have generated.</b>
