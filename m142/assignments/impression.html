<h3>Impressionism</h3>
In this assignment, you will generate drawings using randomly placed smudges whose colors are determined by an image of your choosing.<br><br>

<b>Turning it:</b> To turn in this project, you should place the website in a folder called <b>impression</b> inside of your class website and link the site from your main class homepage.<br><br>

<b>Requirements:</b> <br><br>

The site should contain at least five images, one drawn with each of these types of marks: random line segments, random line segments following a noise pattern, Brownian motion, projectile motion, and noise hair. If you like you can place all of these images on one page with some text describing each one. Alternatively, you can create a photo gallery of the images.<br><br>

Your five (or more) images do not all have to be based on the same image.<br><br>

If you would like to include a link to a spork page which actually does the drawing (which you must have constructed to get your drawings) you may.
