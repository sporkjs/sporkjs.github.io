<h3>Rose Garden</h3>

Create a website that illustrates  the use of parametric equations to draw curves.<br><br>

<b>Turning it in:</b> To turn in this project, you should place the website in a folder called <b>parametric</b> inside of your class website and link the site from your main class homepage.<br><br>

<b>Requirements:</b>
The site should contain at least these pages:
<ul>
<li> (1 page) A home page with a title and links to the pages listed below. Each page below should include a Spork canvas on which your image is drawn.</li>
<li> (1 page) Make a function <b>rose(x,y,r)</b> that draws a rose centered at the point (x,y) with radius r. Modify one of your impressionism assignments to use your rose function.</li>
<li> (1 page) Make a grid of parametric curves such as this: <img src='images/roses.png'>
I suggest you modify your <b>rose(x,y,r)</b> function to become a new function <b>rose(x,y,r,n,m)</b> that draws the rose defined by <i>x=r*COS(n*t)</i> and <i>y=r*SIN(m*t)</i>. You can then vary values of n and m in your grid.
</li>
</ul>
