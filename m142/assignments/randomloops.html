<h3>More Fun With For Loops</h3>

Create a website that illustrates the use of For Loops, Randomness, and Arrays in drawing on the HTML canvas as outlined below.<br><br>

<b>Turning it:</b> To turn in this project, you should place the website in a folder called <b>randomloops</b> inside of your class website and link the site from your main class homepage.<br><br>

<b>Requirements:</b>
The site should contain at least these pages:
<ul>
<li> (1 page) A home page with a title and links to the pages listed below. Each page below should include a Spork canvas on which your image is drawn.</li>
<li> (1 page) Use your creature function to draw copies of your creature on a grid so that every version of the creature is a random size.
<li> (1 page) Create a new <b>randomCreature(x,y,r)</b> function that draws a copy of your creature with random colors at (x,y) with radius r. Use arrays to limit the range of colors that are possible. This may involve these steps:
	<ul>
	<li>Select at least two different regions of your creature that are different colors.</li>
	<li>Rewrite the color declarations for those regions using variables. For example, if my creature has blue eyes, instead of <b>color('blue');</b> I might use <b>color(eyeColor);</b> where eyeColor is a variable.</li>
	<li>Construct an array with possible colors. This might look like <b>var possibleEyeColors=['blue','green','orange'];</b></li>
	<li>Use the arrays to set the random colors. This might look like <b>eyeColor=possibleEyeColors.random();</b></li>
	</ul>
</li>
<li> (1 page) On this page, you will draw a random picture in the style of this Sol Lewitt wall drawing: <img src='images/sollewitt4.jpg'>
You should consider these steps:
	<ul>
	<li>Consider this square centered at (x,y) with width and height 2r: <img src='images/lewittsquare.png'></li>
	<li>Make four functions with calls such as <b>segment1(x,y,r)</b>. One function should draw a line from point A to point E (with a command such as <b>line(x-r,y-r,x+r,y+r);</b>). One function should draw a line from G to C. One should draw a line from H to D, and one should draw a line from B to F.</li>
	<li>If you would like to add (random) color to your functions, feel free.</li>
	<li>Write a program that uses arrays to randomly call one of your four functions at each point in a regular grid.</li>
	</ul>
	<b>If you would rather</b> you can use line segments connecting different points, or you can use some arcs of circles to get a different effect. Here is an example using arcs of circles: <img src="images/tiles.png">
</li>
<li> (1 page) Get copies of circle pattern functions from at least two of your classmates. Use arrays to randomly draw circle patterns at random locations with random sizes.</li>
</ul>
