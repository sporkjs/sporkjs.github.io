<h3>Symmetric Noise Gallery</h3>

Create a website that illustrates  the use of the noise function to draw shapes and patterns.<br><br>

<b>Turning it:</b> To turn in this project, you should place the website in a folder called <b>symmetry</b> inside of your class website and link the site from your main class homepage.<br><br>

<b>Requirements:</b>
The site should contain at least these pages:
<ul>
<li> (1 page) A home page with a title and links to the pages listed below. Each page below should include a Spork canvas on which your image is drawn.</li>
<li> (1 page) Modify the Funky Stripes component of the Noise assignment in the following way to introduce reflection symmetry.
	<ul>
	<li>In this example, we will draw Funky Stripes with a copy reflected in the line y=x. To do so, we need first draw only those points on one side of the line y=x. To do so, we modify the for loop. Change the line <b>for (y=0;y&lt;height;y=y+1)</b> to
	<b>for (y=x;y&lt;height;y=y+1)</b>. This will only give points above the line y=x.</li>
	<li>To impose symmetry, every point we draw we must draw twice - once above the line y=x and once below. After the line <b>fillrect(x,y,1,1);</b> add <b>fillrect(y,x,1,1);</b></li>
	<li>You should now have symmetric funky lines.</li>
	</ul>
</li>
<li> (1 page) Modify the Cow Spots component of the Noise assignment in the same way as above to introduce reflection symmetry.</li>
<li>(1 page) Modify the Funky Stripes component of the Noise assignment in the following way to introduce symmetries about the x and y axes.
	<ul>
	<li>In the setup() function, add <b>translate(width/2, height/2);</b> so that the origin is at the center of the canvas.</li>
	<li>Replace every command of the form <b>fillrect(x,y,1,1);</b> with four commands like we did in the <a href="../examplecode/flakes.html">Snowflakes example</a>. The four commands should be<br>
	<b>fillrect(x,y,1,1);</b> <br>
	<b>fillrect(-x,y,1,1);</b> <br>
	<b>fillrect(x,-y,1,1);</b> <br>
	<b>fillrect(-x,-y,1,1);</b>
	</li>
	</ul>
</li>
<li> (1 page) Modify the Cow Spots component of the Noise assignment in the same way as above to introduce symmetries about the x and y axes.</li>
<li> (1 page) Modify the Hair component of the Noise assignment in the same way as above to introduce symmetries about the x and y axes.</li>
</ul>
