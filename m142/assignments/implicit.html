<h3>Implicit Functions</h3>

Create a website that illustrates the use of implicit lines and circles to draw an image.<br><br>

<b>Turning it:</b> To turn in this project, you should place the website in a folder called <b>implicit</b> inside of your class website and link the site from your main class homepage.<br><br>

<b>Requirements:</b>
<ul>
<li>Each of the main pages below can be based on the same underling image. Your base image should use at least three implicit curves. This should include at least one line and at least one circle.</li>
	<li>The site should contain at least these pages:
		<ul>
		<li> (1 page) A home page with a title and links to the pages listed below. Each page below should include a Spork canvas on which your image is drawn.</li>
		<li> (1 page) A page with your image drawn with regular geometric figures placed on a grid.</li>
		<li> (1 page) A page with your image drawn with regular geometric figures placed randomly.</li>
		<li> (1 page) A page with your image drawn with blotches placed on a grid. For blotches, you can use blotches like we did in class, or you can use your Brownian motion or mark functions from the motion assignment.</li>
		</ul>
	<li>For the randomly placed marks, you can use a for loop with a set number of shapes, or you can use the animation loop. If you use the animation loop, be sure to include a buttons to Stop, Go, and Start Over.</li>
