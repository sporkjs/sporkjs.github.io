<h3>Motion</h3>

Create a website that illustrates  the use of the animation loop to model motion.<br><br>

<b>Turning it:</b> To turn in this project, you should place the website in a folder called <b>motion</b> inside of your class website and link the site from your main class homepage.<br><br>

<b>Requirements:</b>
The site should contain at least these pages:
<ul>
<li> (1 page) A home page with a title and links to the pages listed below. Each page below should include a Spork canvas on which your image is drawn.</li>
<li>
(1 page) On this page, you will draw a fuzz ball by modifying the <a href="../examplecode/motion9.html">Random Acceleration</a> example. To do so, you will need to:
	<ul>
	<li>Add a <b>loop();</b> command to your <b>setup()</b> function. </li>
	<li>In your <b>draw()</b> function, add a small rotation before you start drawing. Do not save or restore.</li>
	<li>In your <b>setup()</b> function, you might want to set the color to have some transparency so that you can see more "fuzziness."</li>
	<li>Experiment with rotation amounts, accelerations, transparencies, colors, and the number of steps in the path.</li>
	<li>Place the resulting code in a web page that includes buttons to Stop, Go, and Start Over.</li>
	</ul>
</li>
<li> (1 page) Make a page that has your creature bouncing with gravity in the Spork canvas. Include buttons for Stop, Go, and Start Over.</li>
<li> (1 page) Modify the <a href="../examplecode/motion1.html">Spots</a> example so that at each random point (x,y) you draw the largest circle centered at that point that lies entirely on the canvas.
The radius of this circle should be <b>min(x, y, width-x, height-y);</b>. Include buttons for Stop, Go, and Start Over.</li>
<li> (1 page) Select at least one of these options:
	<ul>
	<li>Convert the <a href='../examplecode/motion7.html'>Random Mark</a> example to a function <b>mark(x,y)</b> which places a random mark at (x,y).</li> 
	<li>Convert the <a href='../examplecode/motion8.html'>Brownian Motion</a> example to a function <b>mark(x,y)</b> which places a Brownian motion path at (x,y). </li>
	</ul>
	Once you have selected an option, create a page that repeatedly calls <b>mark(x,y);</b> with random x and y. If you like, you can include random colors. As usual, include buttons for Stop, Go, and Start Over.
</li>
</ul>
