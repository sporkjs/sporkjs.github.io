        Aristotle's contributions to science reside mainly with his interest in natural philosophy, now known as physics and zoology. In terms of physics, he looked at the movement, change, matter and position of objects, as well as space and time. He was convinced that people could learn things by having a physical connection with an object. He also recognized that an object could mean something different to individual people based on past experiences and their own interpretations. Lastly, he came up with the conclusion that the outcome of an object varied after being acted upon by outside forces, even if the initial purpose had been something else entirely.

        Another one of Aristotle's scientific contributions can be found in zoology, specifically in classification. He tried, albeit unsuccessfully, to group land animals into separate categories based on external observations. He created two species for animals, those that had red blood and those that didn't. He called the species that had red blood, vertebrates and labeled the others as cephalopods. While his system of classification was incorrect, it became the standard for hundreds of years. He did the same thing with marine animals and studied their structures closely. The classifications that he created for the marine animals were much closer than his land ones had been though.
