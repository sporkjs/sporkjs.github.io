        Aristotle's contributions to philosophy lie mainly with his systematic approach to logic. He thought that there could be a deductive-reasoning process that could apply to everything and anything. In the hopes, that everything would become knowable to mankind.

        First, a person would describe an object based on its attributes, its mental compacities and its actions. Next, other information could be obtained through a process of deduction and inference. His approach to logic is now referred to as syllogism.
      </p>
      <p>
        As explained in his <i>Prior Analytics</i>, a syllogism is, "a discourse in which, certain things having been supposed, something different from the things supposed results of necessity because these things are so." Aristotle believed that the main parts of reasoning could be sorted into "inclusive and exclusive relationships." Later, this theory was adapted visually into Venn diagrams.

        In addition, Aristotle commented on ethics in <i>Nichomachean Ethics</i>. He created his own set of moral codes that he constituted as "good living." However, he acknowledged that there were times that good living didn't necessarily line-up with logic and encouraged people to be cautious while developing their judgment.
