        Aristotle was a Greek philosopher, who made major contributions to many subjects, including philosophy and science. He has been accredited to writing over 200 works, but only of them 31 haven't been lost to time. Subsequently, these writings have been divided into distinct categories: Organon, Physics, Metaphysics, Nicomachean Ethics, Politics, Rhetoric and Poetics. Most of these works appear to have been written during his time at the Lyceum.

        Aristotle was born in 384 BC in Stagirus in the region of Chalcidice, Greece. Both of his parents passed away by the time he was ten-years-old. He was then raised by Proxenus of Atarneus and taught Greek, rhetoric and poetry.

        When Aristotle was seventeen-years-old, he traveled to Athens and became a pupil at Plato's Academy. After finishing his studies, he was asked to teach at the Academy and remained there for twenty years. Near the end of his time at the Academy, however, Aristotle began to disagree with some of Plato's teachings and was therefore not asked to take over when Plato died.

        He then traveled to Assos and the island of Lesbos, where he became interested in studying biology and zoology. Not long after that, he was invited to the court of King Philip II and tutored the king's son, the then thirteen-year-old, Alexander the Great. When Alexander became king, he sent Aristotle to Athens to establish his own school, the Lyceum.

        He spent the next twelve years at the academy, but had to flee Athens after the unexpected death of Alexander. Aristotle traveled back to the birthplace of his mother, Chalcis, and died a year later at the age of 62.
