          Dombis' work is known for being unpredictable and dynamic. He creates his pieces by repeating simple algorithms over and over to create complicated designs. When he starts a piece, he doesn't have an end product in mind, but lets the work evolve from the algorithms that he uses. For example, he might start a piece with a straight line and use the computer to create variations. The possibilities are endless. This process is similar to the Surrealist movement known as the exquisite corpse. Dombis also has noted a similarity between his works and those of the Australian Aborigines' Songlines and Lucretius's atomist philosophy.

          Dombis believes that its his job as an artist to confront the human viewer with their own primitive irrationality. He does this by creating irrationality in his pieces that is caused by the computer, a rational machine. When geometrics are used excessively in a binary system, the geometrics become irrational.
