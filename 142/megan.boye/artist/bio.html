          Pascal Dombis was born in Metz, France in 1965 and currently is living and working in Paris. He graduated from INSA Lyon, one of the top science and technology universities in Europe, with an engineering degree. Right after graduating, Dombis began to pursue his love of art by taking computer art classes that summer at Tufts University. A year later, in 1988, he was included in a group exhibition at the Multi Media Art Gallery in New York City. In the years since, Dombis has been gaining international recognition and has held solo exhibitions at the Claudio Bottello Contemporary in Italy in 2011, Le Muse en Herbe in Paris in 2012 and the RAYGUN Art Projects in Australia in 2014.
