In the 1220s Leonardo was invited to appear before the emperor at Pisa, and there John of Palermo, a member of Frederick’s scientific entourage, propounded a series of problems, three of which Leonardo presented in his books. The first two belonged to a favourite Arabic type, the indeterminate, which had been developed by the 3rd-century Greek mathematician Diophantus. This was an equation with two or more unknowns for which the solution must be in rational numbers (whole numbers or common fractions). The third problem was a third-degree equation (i.e., containing a cube), x3 + 2x2 + 10x = 20 (expressed in modern algebraic notation), which Leonardo solved by a trial-and-error method known as approximation; he arrived at the answer
</p>

<p>
For several years Leonardo corresponded with Frederick II and his scholars, exchanging problems with them. He dedicated his Liber quadratorum (1225; “Book of Square Numbers”) to Frederick. Devoted entirely to Diophantine equations of the second degree (i.e., containing squares), the Liber quadratorum is considered Leonardo’s masterpiece.

<p>
It is a systematically arranged collection of theorems, many invented by the author, who used his own proofs to work out general solutions. Probably his most creative work was in congruent numbers—numbers that give the same remainder when divided by a given number. He worked out an original solution for finding a number that, when added to or subtracted from a square number, leaves a square number. His statement that x2 + y2 and x2 - y2 could not both be squares was of great importance to the determination of the area of rational right triangles.

<p>
Although the Liber abaci was more influential and broader in scope, the Liber quadratorum alone ranks Leonardo as the major contributor to number theory between Diophantus and the 17th-century French mathematician Pierre de Fermat.

<p>
Except for his role in spreading the use of the Hindu-Arabic numerals, Leonardo’s contribution to mathematics has been largely overlooked. His name is known to modern mathematicians mainly because of the Fibonacci sequence derived from a problem in the Liber abaci
