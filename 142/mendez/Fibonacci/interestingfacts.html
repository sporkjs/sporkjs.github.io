	Leonardo did not discover the Fibonacci number, but used the sequence an example in his important book.
</p>
<p>
	In his book, he supported the system of numeration that follow the digits 0-9 and their place values.
</p>
<p>
He demonstrated the practical efficiency of this kind of numbering by applying it to a wide variety of mathematics-based areas of commerce, such as bookkeeping, weights and measures, interest and money-changing, and other applications.
</p>
<p>
Unlike accounts of researchers whose ideas seem too radical for their day, Liber Abaci was well received among most of the educated people of Europe, and made a significant impression on education.
</p>
<p>
The Fibonacci number is the series of numbers starting with one (in Leonardo's calculation) or zero (in modern calculation) and adding the next digit to itself until that sum is later added. The sequence is as follows: 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, 233, 377.
</p>
<p>
This number sequence was the solution to an understanding on rabbit populations and their exponential growth.
</p>
<p>
While Leonardo is credited with bringing this understanding to Europe, Arab mathematicians had solved this problem sequence as early as the sixth century.
