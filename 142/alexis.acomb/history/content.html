        Euclid is known as a Greek mathematician who became the "Father of Geometry". He is known to have taught during the reign of Ptolemy I. He wrote "Elements", which served to be one of the most influential mathematical books. When Euclid wasn't tutoring in the Alexandria library, he was creating different elements of mathematics such as geometric systems, infinite values, factorizations, and the congruence of shapes that went on to the contour of Euclidean Geometry. He was heavily influenced by Pythagoras, Aristotle, Eudoxus, and Thales.

        Little is known about his early life except that Euclid was born in the mid-4th century BC and lived in Alexandria, Egypt. The world didn't know much about him until a philosopher named Proclus wrote:
      "Not much younger than these [pupils of Plato] is Euclid, who put together the "Elements", arranging in order many of Eudoxus's theorems, perfecting many of Theaetetus's, and also bringing to irrefutable demonstration the things which had been only loosely proved by his predecessors. This man lived in the time of the first Ptolemy; for Archimedes, who followed closely upon the first Ptolemy makes mention of Euclid, and further they say that Ptolemy once asked him if there were a shorted way to study geometry than the Elements, to which he replied that there was no royal road to geometry."
