	I had heard from a professor about a sixth grade teacher somewhere who had their students keep journals as if they were actual passengers onboard the Titanic. This is what inspired my WebQuest. The WebQuest encourages students to read about the Titanic and to read about different eyewitness accounts. It encourages students to truly think about what it was like living through such a tragedy. In addition, the WebQuest reinforces writing skills, speaking skills, and skills with the use of technology.

I hope you have enjoyed my WebQuest!
