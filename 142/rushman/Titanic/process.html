<p>
	<b>Step Two:</b> <i>Decide the perspective you are choosing to write from. List your chosen name and age at the beginning of your journal entry. </i>
</p>
<p>
	Questions to consider: <ul>
<li>Are you male or female?</li>
<li>Are you writing as a young child or someone who is elderly?</li>
<li>Are you married?</li>
<li>Do you have kids along with you?</li> </ul>
</p>
 <!--   ol for numbered list.....bold is <b></b> and italic is <i></i> -->
<p>
	<b>Step Three:</b> <i>Decide what part of the journey you are going to write about.</i>
	Your journal entry can be about any part of the journey, it is your choice!
</p>
<p>
	<img class="smallRight" src= 'titanic4.jpg'>
</p>
<p>
	Examples of what your journal entry could be about: <ul>
<li>Boarding the ship and setting sail</li>
<li>Your surroundings and what the ship looks like</li>
<li>What happened when the ship hit the iceberg</li>
<li>What was happening as the ship was sinking</li>
<li>Being in the lifeboat</li>
<li>Getting rescued by the Carpathia</li>
</p>
<p>
<b>Step Four:</b> <i>Write the journal entry!</i>
<br>Be sure to really place yourself in the shoes of the perspective that you have chosen. Include as many facts and details as possible that will demonstrate knowledge of the sinking of the Titanic.
</p>
<p>
Questions to consider: <ul>
<li>What were your thoughts and emotions as different things were occurring?</li>
<li>What was occurring with the ship?</li>
<li>How were other people acting?</li>
</p>
<p>
<b><i>The Video:</b></i>
</p>
<p>
<b>Step One:</b> <i>Choose and download the app that you would like to use to create your video.</i>
<br>The app you choose must include a way to show pictures and a way to add your own voice. Examples include shadow puppet or videolicious. Make sure you become familiar with app and its different features.
</p>
<p>
Questions to consider:<ul>
<li>Which app do you feel best helps you tell your story?</li>
</p>
<p>
<b>Step Two:</b> <i>Find and select pictures to use in your video.</i>
<br>The pictures need to be unique to the personal story that you are telling. If you are describing the room that you are staying in on the Titanic, include a picture of one of the rooms. Make sure the pictures help bring your story to life. Include as many or as few pictures that you feel that you need to make the most impact in telling your story. You must include a minimum of one picture.
</p>
<p>
<b>Step Three:</b> <i>Decide what you would like to say during the video.</i>
Your video should not exactly duplicate everything written of in the journal. In your video, include the main ideas written of in your journal that you think would be the most significant for a listener to learn about your particular perspective. Have something in front of you to read when you record your voice in the video.
</p>
<p>
<b>Step Four:</b> <i>Create a new project/video and add your selected pictures in the order that you wish for them to appear.</i>
</p>
<p>
<b>Step Five:</b> <i>Record the voice to complete the creation of your video.</>
You need to speak in a way that portrays the character that you have become and the emotions that they are experiencing.
</p>
<p>
<b>Step Six:</b> <i>Send me the link to your video.</i>
