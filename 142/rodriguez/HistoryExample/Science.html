<p>				
Thales appears to have been the first of the Greek scholars to attempt to explain natural phenomena without relying on the intervention of the gods. 
</p>

<p>
He attempted to lay out basic assumptions from which he could explain the natural world and, in so doing, became one of the first to embrace the scientific method.
</p>

<p>
One of the basic assumptions that Thales worked from is that all matter in nature was built from a common principle or element. 
</p>

<p>
For Thales, that original principle of matter was water. 
</p>

<p>
Thales also suggested that the Earth itself must float on top of water.
</p>

<p>
This assumption allowed him to explain earthquakes as the result of the Earth bouncing in the waves of the supporting water.
</p>

<p>
Some of Thales' explanations of natural phenomena (such as earthquakes) were incorrect.
</p>

<p>
The significance of his contribution to science or natural philosophy is that he posed basic assumptions or hypotheses from which he explained nature free from interferance from the gods. 
</p>

<p>
This method of explaining nature could easily be tested and either supported or rejected. 
</p>

<p>
Reasoning from hypotheses for the first time allowed for disagreement, discussion, and debate among educated men that did not necessarily end in an appeal to gods or personal attack. 
</p>

<p>
For example, Cicero and Aristotle seem to indicate that Thales believed the Earth to be a sphere. 
</p>

<p>
His followers Anaximenes and Anaximander did not agree. 
</p>

<p>
They debated the scientifice evidence, and the result was that their school taught that the Earth was a thin flat disk that floated upon water.
</p>

<p>
The manner in which Thales' school sought to build knowledge was to observe nature and to abstract basic principles or state hypotheses. 
</p>

<p>
These principles could then be tested and debated.
</p>

<p>
They could be followed to their logical conclusions and then refined if need be. 
</p>

<p>
This was the birth of what we today call the scientific method.
