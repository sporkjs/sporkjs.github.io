Abel constributed to math in many different ways.
</p>

<p>
1. Abel's biggest contribution was proving that there is no general method to solve 5th degree polynomial using arithmetic and roots.

<p>
2. Using these he also determined what characteristics polynomial's can be solved by using arithmetic and roots.
</p>

<p>
3. Because of his many tours and studies with mathmiticians Abel's name was also attached to several topics ranging from Alegbra, Geometry, chemistry, and qauntum mechanics.
</p>

<p>
4. Abel also accomplished several ground breaking research in power series which are infinitely long polynomials
