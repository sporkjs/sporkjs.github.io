        Leonhard Euler was a mathematician born in Basel, Switzerland on April 15, 1707. His father, a pastor, encouraged him to also become part of the clergy. However, Euler was instead interested in math, though he never studied it previous to college. Euler was enrolled at the University of Basel in 1720, at the age of 14; Euler obtained his Master's degree by the age of 16.

        After graduating the University of Basel Euler applied to be a professor at the school but was turned down. He instead was hired to teach mathematics and physiology in 1727 at St. Petersburg Academy of Sciences and in 1730 became a physics professor at the Academy. In 1733 Euler became the Chair of Mathematics at the St Petersburg Academy of Sciences. In 1735 Euler lost sight in one eye, which is speculated to be because of intense eye strain among other health problems. As his eyes progressively became worse--he eventually lost sight in his other eye and became completely blind around 1776--Euler began doing intense mathematical equations in his head.

        Leonhard Euler is considered one of the most prolific writers in mathematics with over 886 papers and books published. Many of Euler's works were published posthumously by St. Petersburg Academy. Euler died from a brain hemorrhage on September 18, 1783 in St. Petersburg, Russia.
