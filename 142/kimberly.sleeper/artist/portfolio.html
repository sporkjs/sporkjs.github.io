        Scott Draves is most well known for his Electric Sheep program. However, Draves began programming in the mid 1980s. He started to submit his works and received an Honorable Mention at Prix Ars Electronica, a well known prize for computer animation and electronic art, for his Fractal Flames. Fractal Flames have since been installed as plug-ins into Photoshop and After Effects to aid other artists in their own creations.

      Developed in 1999, Electric Sheep is Draves' most well known work. Electric Sheep is a distributed computing software, meaning multiple computers come together to form and interact with the program. The program is similar to Draves' Fractal Frames, but moves across the screen and is more interactive. The title for the program is taken from Philip K. Dick's novel <i>Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?</i>; the computer the program runs on could be compared to an android, the concept of dreams integrates with the program as it runs in the background, and the moving fractals on screen are refered to as "Sheep" by Draves and its users. Users can create their own sheep and submit them as well as vote for their favorite Sheep, which then may combine together to form another sheep. Draves states that the program lives to please the user as it is created and changed by those who have the program downloaded. Draves later added "intelligent design" to Electric Sheep based upon his algorithm Apophysis. This update to the program allowed users to contribute and revise the program and see their additions in real time via the web. Currently, Electric Sheep is available on most interfaces, including iPad and Android phones.
