  Jean-Pierre Hébert uses many materials for his works. One of the more impressive feats is his dedication to doing artwork by hand. Hébert very rarely uses a printer and is an impressive craftsman which is shown by his hand done works. He puts his works on film, paper, wood, linoleum, glass, metal, air, water, and sand. Hébert draws anything from small to large, basic to high tech, and even cartoons. The drawings come from code which shows up on a computer and is then translated into lines, shapes, and many other designs. Some examples of his work both computerized and done by hand are:
