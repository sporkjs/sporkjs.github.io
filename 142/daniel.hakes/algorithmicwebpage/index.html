Jean-Pierre Hébert is the founding father of algorithmic art and is well known for his work with sand, water, and wind. He has made many contributions to the field of algorithmic and generative art. Hébert began his career as an engineer and computer programmer. He was very interested in the arts and in mathematics. Because of this, in 1979 he was able to create drawings based on computer code. From then on he was a devoted artist. The people that inspired Hébert were Manfred Mohr, Benoit Mandelbrot’s Fractal Geometry of Nature, and Helaman Ferguson.

Jean-Pierre Hébert is one of few pioneers of the digital art field. He experimented with computer drawings starting in the mid-1970’s and in 1995 co-founded the group of artists known as Algorists. Hébert combines mathematics, geometry, physics, and poetry into works of art through sand, water, and wind. His works are known as being expressions of quiet beauty and peaceful meditation which is obvious with his smooth yet precise lines of his artistic creations.

Jean-Pierre Hébert is also involved in the film industry. He began by using live animation which is put on film and sent through a projector. Usually, these arts are used during live events of dances and music concerts such as jazz festivals. Today these works are computer based.
