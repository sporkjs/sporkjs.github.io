Jean-Pierre Hébert uses many different kinds of technology. Weather he is putting code into a computer or rolling a ball on a sand pattern, there are many different methods he is able to use. Hébert is an advocate for simple and easy to use technology so artists, including himself, can focus more on making their artwork instead of working through a complicated computer program.

      Hébert enjoys doing some of his work on a computer for the reasons of computers being able to answer mathematical inquiries, free his imagination, and build off of previous designs. Computers also are able to set devices into motion in ways such as animation which empowers the mind to do more work than the hands. Because mathematics is the base for which computers run, the options are unlimited in terms of creativity for artists such as Hébert.

The computers Jean-Pierre Hébert used are the Lisp in the 60’s, Hewlett Packard small Rocky Mountain Basic machine and plotter in the 70’s, a PC in the 80’s, Mathematica and Linux in the 90’s, and today the Mac OS X and Python. While computers are obviously a big part of his artwork, Hébert does not use software tools for his creative work because he does not want unneeded complexity.
