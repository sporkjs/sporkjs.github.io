Pythagoras was an interesting man when it came to religion. He considered religion and science to be viewed as inseparable and interconnected. He believed in Metempsychosis which is known as the supposed transmigration when a soul of a human being or animal dies and moves into a new body of the same or a different species. Pythagoras also suggested that the thought process of the soul came from the brain and not the heart. According to the religion of Pythagoras, a soul was an immortal being which was imprisoned in a material body. Also, they believed that the body contaminated the soul and the through purification the soul could finally be freed. However, if the soul was not purified it would keep on passing through body after body until finally purification was achieved. This happened when the soul was released completely from its connecting body and returned to the gods. This is similar to Peter Pan losing his shadow.
