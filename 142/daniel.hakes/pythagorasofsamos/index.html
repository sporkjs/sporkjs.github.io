Pythagoras of Samos, also known as the "first true mathematician" and "father of numbers", was born around 569 B.C. He had at least two brothers in his family. His father was a merchant from Tyre and his mother was from Samos. Pythagoras was influenced by a few important mathematical figures such as Pherecydes, Anaximander, and Thales of Miletus.

Pythagoras was extremely interested in many subjects such as math, astronomy, and cosmology. Thales of Miletus was thought to have introduced mathematics to Pythagoras which led to his interest in these subjects. Concepts of numbers as well as numbers themselves drew Pythagoras to mathematics. This led to one of his many theories that all relations are able to be reduced into forms of numbers. Another theory which is still used today with musical instruments is that vibrating strings produce sounds based on ratios and scales. This led to many important music theory contributions.

Pythagoras studied numbers and how they fit with shapes such as triangles, squares, and rectangles. His most famous and greatest contribution to mathematics is the Pythagoras Theorem. While the Babylonians were credited with the discovery, Pythagoras was the first person to prove it.

Around 520 BC, Pythagoras left Samos and went to Croton in southern Italy where he started a school in 530 BC. He stayed there until leaving for Metapontum where he died in 490 BC. After his death, people realized his importance as a founder of the scientific and philosophical movement across Greece, while others even saw him as a mythical creature.
