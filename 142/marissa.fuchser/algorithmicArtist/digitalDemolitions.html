      Brandon Morse's work with 'digital destruction' is especially interesting. They are patterns and animations that collapse atarting at one trigger point. In an article in an Art in America magazine, Kristin Capps writes that this work is "a more passive form of destruction with the emphasis on the collapse iteself." The path of destruction is based on a system of rules he designed himself. These works are a combination of patterns and animation. The animations that he creates are displayed with projections on large walls, making the work much more interective.

Many of his works are associated with differnt meanings and purposes that range from economics to terrorism. His animations show the collapse of buildings and structures that suggest earthquakes and destruction without actually showing the cause of destruction. His work titles "Achilles" is one that is scene as a representation of finances and economic recessions. Another piece associated with finances is "More Destroyment." This one being a representation of the domino effect.
