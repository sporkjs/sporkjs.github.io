      <p>Galileo Galilei is known as the father of modern science. He studied a variety of things including physics, astronomy, cosmology, mathematics, and philosophy. One of his greatest accomplishments was an improved telescope. With that telescope he was able make several more groundbreaking discoveries in the field of astronomy. He was also able to disprove many of Aristotle’s theories and improve on the theories and views of the Universe.

    He attended the University of Pisa but, due to financial problems, never earned his degree. Even so, he went on to teach at the University of Pisa a few years later from 1589-1592. Later on he went to teach at the University of Padua. In addition to teaching, Galileo wrote several books during his lifetime including The Starry Messenger (1610), The Discourse of Bodies on Water, (1612), and Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems (1632).

    Among all of his research and discoveries, one of the things he is most known for is his support of the Copernican Theory of a heliocentric universe. When the Church declared this theory heretical, Galileo was forced to recant his belief and quit promoting the idea of the heliocentric universe. When his book Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems was published, it was decided that his book was promoting the heliocentric universe and was placed on the Church’s banned books list until 1744 and Galileo was put under house arrest until he death in 1642.
