Bernhard Reimann was born on the 7th of September in 1826 to Friedrich and Charlotte Ebell. His father, a Lutheran minister, was a significant figure in Bernhard's life as well as a great influence in his education. Friedrich taught Bernhard along with his five siblings until he was ten years old. Bernhard lived with his grandmother and entered the classes at the Lyceum in Hannover at the age of 14. After his grandmother's death in 1842, he transferred to the Johanneum Gymnasium in Luneberg where he studied several subjects including Hebrew, theology and mathematics. It was at this age that he began to take special interest in mathematics.

Four years later, Riemann enrolled at the University of Gottingen. He entered the theology faculty, yet still attended mathematics lectures. As he became more and more interested in mathematics, he soon transferred to the faculty of philosophy; with his father's permission of course. It was Bernhard's father who had encouraged him to pursue a career in theology; his opinions had always been very important to Riemann. It was then that he began to take rather elementary classes from Gauss and Stern at Gottingen. The University of Gottingen was not the best place to study math, but Stern had already begun to see Riemann's talent. In 1847 he moved to Berlin University and began studying from Steiner, Jacobi, Dirichlet and Eisenstein. Eisenstein and Dirichlet were major influences at this point in his life. It was there at Berlin University that Reimann worked out his general theory of complex variables and began some of his most important work. In 1849 he returned to Gottingen where he made more discoveries and theories related to the theory of functions, complex analysis and number theory.
