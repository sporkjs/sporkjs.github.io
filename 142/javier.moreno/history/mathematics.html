        <img class="mediumLeft" src="images/probability.jpg"> As soon as Laplace moved to Paris to the Ecole Militaire, He began producing remarkable mathematical papers. His first paper was on maxima and minima of curves where he improved on methods given by Lagrange. His next paper concerned differential equations.

        In 1785, Laplace took the key forward step in using integrals in order to transform a whole difference equation, rather than simply as a form for the solution, and found that the transformed equation was easier to solve than the original.

        Laplace was a member of the committee of the Académie des Sciences to standardise weights and measures in May 1790. This committee worked on the metric system and advocated a decimal base.

        On of the most remarkable papers published by Laplace  was the first edition of "Laplace's Théorie Analytique des Probabilités" in 1812. It covered the generation of functions, approximations to various expressions occurring in probability theory, Laplace's definition of probability, Bayes's rule, least squares, Buffon's needle problem, inverse probability, and applications to mortality, life expectancy, the length of marriages, and legal matters.<img class="mediumRightdist" src="images/distribution.png">
