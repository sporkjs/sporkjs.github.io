        <p><em>Please keep in mind that not all disabilities are visible and those that are aren't any easier. Service dogs are there to help lessen the impact of the handlers disability.</em> <br><br>

Service dogs aren't limited to just hearing and guide dogs. Dogs are amazing animals and can be trained to do a number of things. These catagories can sometimes be overlapped. For example, a handler may classify their dog as a wheelchair assistant and seizure alert dog. This doesn't mean it's anyless of a service dog, the dog just covers a wider variety of tasks.<br><br>

Under the ADA law, service dogs do not need to be registered. They are also protected by the Fair Housing Act (FHA) meaning a service dog cannot be denied to live in an apartment or a no animal rental house.<br><br>

Service dogs are trained to do a specific set of tasks for their handler. This can include a number of commands including basic obedience. Some handlers will self-train or have a professional help them train their dog. Here are a few commands that a service dog might perform for their handler:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Momentum Pull / Brace command</li>
    <li>Deep Pressure Therapy</li>
    <li>Interupt and re-direct an action</li>
    <li>Bring help</li>
    <li>Retrieve medication</li>
    <li>Pick up items </li>
</ul>

<p>Again, tasks are based upon what best fits the handlers needs. Some service dogs don't need to be trained certain tasks because their owner won't need that specific kind of help. There are many things a service dog can do and in the business, you either use it or lose it.</p>
