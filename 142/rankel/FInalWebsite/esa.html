        <p id="Title">Emotional Support Animals</p>
      <p>Emotional Support Animals (ESA) are not the same as service dogs. An ESA can be any animal (within reason but is usually a dog) and are typically defined as companion animals. For example, Carrie Fisher has an emotional support animal named Gary who is a French Bulldog.<br><br>

Emotional support dogs are often referred to as therapy dogs, companion dogs, or comfort dogs by both the public and health professionals. They are basically household pets, and as such require no special training, certification or registration, nor are they required to have ID cards or wear vests.<br><br>

However, while all dogs provide love and emotional support, the designation of emotional support dog is only applicable to dogs which have been prescribed by a licensed mental health professional. The mental health professional must document the need for their client to have an emotional support dog, which is typically done in the form of a letter.<br><br>

ESA's are not trained to do any specific tasks unlike service dogs or therapy animals. As long as an ESA is reasonably behaved, that is training enough. They aren't protected under ADA laws and don't have protected public access like service dogs. So if a public place says you can't come in with your ESA, unfortunately you cannot go in. ESA's are also not covered under the Fair Housing Act (FHA), but with a doctors note you should be able to defend your case for needing your animal (if it is an animal within reason).</p>
