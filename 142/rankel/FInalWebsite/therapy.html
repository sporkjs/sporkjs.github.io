        <p id="Title">Therapy Dogs</p>
      <p>Therapy dogs are a type of working dog, but are not the same as a service dog. Therapy Dogs can be seen in hospitals visiting people, nursing homes, and even classrooms. They have basic obedience training and are constantly tested on skills as well as temperment. Therapy dogs can register through an organization once they pass the required tests. Registration is not only good for the trainer, but it is also good for the places they visit. Registration give the handler liability insurance if anything were to go wrong. It also gives promotional information, regional club listings, and community resources. It is reccomended to register a therapy dog becuase it helps the facilites they visit feel more comfortable about the interaction with the dog during the visit.<br><br>
        A therapy animal must enjoy human contact and excessive petting. And they must be comfortable staying in place, whether it is on a floor, chair, couch, bed or lap, or in their handler's arms. Therapy animals do not need to perform, though a few simple tricks will surely delight their audiences.<br><br>

Therapy animals must obey basic obedience commands, and be tolerant of disturbances such as:

<ul>
    <li>Clumsy handling by children and elderly people (though the animal's handler should never let their animal be abused)</li>
    <li>Equipment such as wheelchairs, walkers, crutches and canes</li>
    <li>Sudden and loud noises</li>
    <li>The surprise of seeing another animal in a facility</li>
</ul>

        Dogs, cats, guinea pigs, rabbits, domesticated rats, horses, donkeys, llamas, alpacas, pot-bellied pigs and birds can all be used in therapy animal work.<br><br>
