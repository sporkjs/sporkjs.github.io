      <p>There are three main catagories of working dogs: Service Dogs, Therapy Dogs, and Emotional Support Animals. Each catagory is different than the other and some have more protection under the law. This website is a friendly and helpful compilation of information that I've learned about. All of my sources can be found on the source page with a brief description of each website. Feel free to click on them to learn more on your own time. I hope this page helps educate you on the difference between these three classes of working dogs.</p>

      My name is Taylor Ray. I'm a 2nd year graphic design student. I go to college in Seward, Nebraska and it's the coolest little town ever. I created this website to help me learn coding as well as give information on service animals. I'm in process of recieving a psychiatric service dog and wanted to share everything I've learned in the past year. Some people have judged me and made rude remarks since I've began this journey, but I've learned to handle these situations well. I want this site to be used as a way to inform people about our animals. Sometimes answering questions is exhausting, so why not just hand them a website link instead?
