    <td>Service Dog Central is a community of service dog partners and trainers working together to bring you our combined knowledge about service dogs. Our goal is to bring you the latest, most accurate, most useful information about service dogs available anywhere.</td>
    <td>This guide provides an overview of how major Federal civil rights laws govern the rights of a person requiring a service animal. These laws, as well as instructions on how to file a complaint, are listed in the last section of this publication.</td>
    <td>The ADA requires State and local government agencies, businesses, and non-profit organizations (covered entities) that provide goods or services to the public to make "reasonable modifications" in their policies, practices, or procedures when necessary to accommodate people with disabilities.</td>
    <td>IAADP's overall mission is to foster the assistance dog movement in the USA and other countries. As part of this mission, we seek to promote the responsible use of access rights in the disabled community.</td>
    <td>Anything Pawsable is an online magazine for Service and Working Dog owners. Our hope is to create a welcoming environment for Service and Working Dog owners and trainers of all levels, for their friends and families - and for the able-bodied community as well who may be fans of Service or Working Dogs or are looking to learn more about them.</td>
