            <p>Johannes Kepler was born on December 27, 1571 in Weil der Stadt, W&uuml;rttemberg, Germany. As a young child he was constantly sick and his parents were poor. As he grew, his intelligence earned him a scholarship to the University of Tubingen. There he would study Lutheran ministry. Yet while he was there he became acquainted the ideas of Copernicus and was very interested. A few years later as a teacher in Graz, he wrote the first outspoken defence of the Copernican system. </p>

            <p>He later was forced to leave his teaching post due to the counter reformation because he was Lutheran, but this landed him a spot to work with the Danish Astronomer Tycho Brahe. When Tycho died in 1601, Kepler inherited his post as the Imperial Mathematician.  in 1609, he published his first two laws of planetary motion. In 1619, he published his third law.</p>

            <p>In 1621, Kepler published <i>Epitome Astronomiae</i>. This was his most influential work and discussed all of heliocentric astronomy in a systematic way. Later he published the <i>Rudolphine Tables</i> that he and Tycho envisioned long ago. These included calculations using logarithms, which he developed, and provided tables for calculating planetary positions for any past or future date. Kepler used the tables to predict a pair of transits by Mercury and Venus of the Sun, although he did not live to witness the events.</p>

            <p>Johannes Kepler died in Regensburg in 1630 while on his way to collect a debt in Sagan. </p>
