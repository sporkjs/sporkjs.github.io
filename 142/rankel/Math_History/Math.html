            <p>Astronomy had once been considered as a branch of mathematics. Kepler, known as a mathematician, studied astronomy and the math he was doing then would be considered Physics today.</p>

            <p>Kepler himself kept a diary of mathematical equations that explained his laws of planetary motion. It's noted that his second law is sometimes called the "area law". Kepler's method of finding area was similar to Archimedes yet not exactly the same. It wasn't as rigid and marks a new technique called "calculus of invisibles".</p>

            <p>Before Kepler asserted that planets moved in an elliptical motion, he tried different shapes using a limited number of observations to find the right curve. As he did this, he adjusted where necessary and came to the conclusion that planes move in an ellipse rather than a circle.</p>
