<p> <b>Assignment:</b> In this project, we were asked to write a function that would ask the user for their gender and their last name.  Then based on the user's inputs, it would generate a response to greet the user.  If the user's answers were not in the correct format, the program would respond with "Sorry, I could not understand you." </p>
<br>
<p> <b>Tools:</b> In order to complete this, we used the variable, function, button, random, and conditional statements from JavaScript programming and the Spork editor to make it come to life.</p>
