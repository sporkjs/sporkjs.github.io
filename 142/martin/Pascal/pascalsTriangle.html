Pascal's triangle is a triangular form of binomial coefficients. Although the triangle is named after  the mathematician it has been used for hundreds of years before Pascal came into existence. Pascal did extensive research on the triangle and created Traite du triangle arithmetique "Treatise on the Arithmetical Triangle". Before him people knew the basics of what the triangle was, but Pascal went deeper and found properties that the triangle held that had not been explained through a series of proofs. He defined the numbers through recursion. In 1654 he proved Pascal's identity which was part of Faulhaber's formula. In that same year he also he met with Pierre de Fermat and from that the idea of the mathematical theory of probabilities was formed.
