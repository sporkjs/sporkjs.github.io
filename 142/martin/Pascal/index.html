				Blaise Pascal was a French mathematician, physicist, inventor, and more. Pascal was born in Clemont-Ferrand in 1623 and lived until 1662. His father was a government official and worked as a royal tax officer. He was deemed as a child prodigy and was educated by his father instead of having a formal education. He invented many things including Pascal's wager, triangle, law, and theorem. Pascal also made contributions to studies of fluids, and concepts of pressure and vacuum.

				At a young age Pascal already accomplished many things. He began working on a calculating machine in his late teens. As a teenager he also wrote a piece on projective geometry and collaborated on probability theory. Pascal was a very influential figure in development of social science and modern economics. He made several contributions to mathematics including a description for Pascal's triangle and a philosophy of mathematics. He did studies of hydrodynamics and hydrostatics in the physical science field. Pascal played a big role in many areas of mathematics.
