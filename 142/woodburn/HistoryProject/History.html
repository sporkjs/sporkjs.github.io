Aristotle  <img class="smallRight" src='images/aristotle2.jpg'>

<p> Born in 384 BC, Aristotle was a Greek Philosopher, Physicist, Logician, and Marine Biologist. At the age of seventeen he was sent to study in Plato's Academy. Once in Athens, Aristotle remained associated with the Academy until Plato's death. Soon after Plato's death he left for Assos, in Asia Minor, on the northwest coast of present-day Turkey. There he continued the philosophical activity he had begun in the Academy. It was here that he undertook his pioneering research into marine biology and married his wife Pythias, with whom he had his only daughter, also named Pythias. Much later in his career, Aristotle set up his own school in Athens its name was the Lyceum. Due to political reasons he withdrew to Chalcis, on Euboea, an island off the Attic coast in 321, and died there of natural causes in 322. He asked to be buried next to his wife, who had died some years before.</p>
	<p> Aristotle wrote a great body of work, perhaps numbering as many as two-hundred treatises, from which only thirty-one survive. His writings include a wide range of disciplines, from logic, metaphysics and philosophy of mind, through ethics, political theory, aesthetics and rhetoric, and into such primarily non-philosophical fields as empirical biology, where he gave detailed observation and descriptions of plants and animals.</p>
