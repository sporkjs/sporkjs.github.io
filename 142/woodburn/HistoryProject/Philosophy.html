Aristotle contributed to philosophy in many ways, from metaphysics to our understanding of what beauty is.

<p> Metaphysics is defined as "the branch of philosophy that deals with the first principles of things, including abstract concepts such as being, knowing, substance, cause, identity, time, and space.
abstract theory or talk with no basis in reality." Metaphysics asks the questions: What is being? What is a thing? and seeks to answer them. Aristotle himself did not use that title or even describe his field of study as 'metaphysics'; the name was evidently coined by the first century C.E. editor who assembled the treatise we know as Aristotle's Metaphysics out of various smaller selections of Aristotle's works. They were to be studied after his treatises dealing with nature. In Physics we are taught that a moving thing, if nothing disturbs it, will continue moving forever. There is a powerful account of the world, which assumes inertia, appealing to those experiences that suggest that motion at an unchanging speed is a state no different from that of rest.</p>

 <p> Plato, Aristotle's teacher and peer, believed the world to have two sides, one being that which we perceive with our eyes and senses, the other being an ideal world free from emotion and illusion. Aristotle, on the other hand, considered reality to be perceived through the natural world. Plato and Aristotle had very different views on the importance of the arts. For Plato the arts were a distraction from his ideal society.  Aristotle saw them as a way to depict the very best of humanity in both ability and aesthetics.</p>
