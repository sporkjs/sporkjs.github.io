  <p>Johannes Kepler was a German mathematician, astronomer, and astrologer born in 1571. Kepler's family was very poor, he was fortunate to have a great mind and receive a scholarship to obtain a good education. After refusing to conform to Catholicism he left Graz and moved to Prague to work with Tycho Brahe, an astronomer. After Brahe died, Kepler continued to study and discovered that the orbit of Mars was an ellipse. Kepler published his discoveries, now known as Kepler's first two laws of planetary motion. This also made him the first to use the scientific method. Perhaps the most influential work done by Kepler was his published writing, the Epitome Astronomiae in 1621. This writing discussed all of heliocentric astronomy in a systematic way. Later, Kepler published Rudolphine Tables from the help of Brahe's visions. This encompassed calculations using logarithms, which he created, and continuous tables for calculating planetary motion of any past or future date. These tables were used to predict transits of Mercury and Venus. Unfortunately for him, Kepler did not live to witness the events. He died in 1630 while on his journey home to Sagan. Kepler's grave was destroyed within two years of his death because of the Thirty Years War.
