  <p>German astronomer Johannes Kepler used mathematics to calculate the path of the planets, finding that they traveled not in circles, as long expected, but in ellipses. Astronomy had previously been a branch of mathematics, that is, the business of astronomers was only to provide the means of calculating the positions of planets. Kepler brought astronomy into natural philosophy by proposing to find the actual paths of the planets in relation to the Sun.</p>
<p> Although Kepler was a mathematician, he was doing what we would now call Physics. To find the paths of the planets he would need to use advanced forms of mathematics. He tried to make his proofs as sound as possible by stating the steps out in great detail and emphasizing the physical basis for his mathematical procedures. Kepler's methods influenced the thinkers of the time, and are an important step in the development of proofs. Astronomers learned to ask not whether a theory was right or wrong but whether it fitted the observations to within the known margin of error.
