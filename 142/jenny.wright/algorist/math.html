As a sculptor of constructive geometric forms, Hart's work deals with patterns and relationships derived from classical ideals of balance and symmetry.  Mathematical yet organic, these abstract forms invite the viewer to partake of the geometric aesthetic.  He uses a variety of materials, including paper, wood, plastic, metal, and common household objects.

Hart stated, "Classical forms are pushed in new directions, so viewers can take pleasure in their Platonic beauty yet recognize how they are updated for our complex high-tech times.  I share with many artists the idea that a pure form is a worthy object, and select for each piece the materials that best carry that form. In one series of pieces, familiar objects are arranged in engaging configurations, displaying an essential tension between mundane individual components and the strikingly original totality."

Hart's works invite contemplation. They slowly reveal their content to the viewers. Some of his works are considered meditation objects. Hart believes that the integral wholeness of each self-contained sculpture presents a crystalline purity, a conundrum of complexity, and a stark simplicity.
