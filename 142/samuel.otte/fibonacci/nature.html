        The work of Leonardo of Pisa has been not only important and impactful, but also relatable. Throughout nature and the daily lives of people, Fibonacci's sequence is found. The way that plants are shaped, buildings and structures are formed, the way DNA is formed, and also the way the structure behind the numbers of the animal reproduction.

        There are very many flowers that have pieces of their plant that resemble the Fibonacci numbers. From the amount of leaves on a stem, to the amount of petals that certain flowers have. Many of the Fibonacci sequence numbers take place in plants. Flowers like lilies have 3 petals, and then certain roses have 5, and delphiniums have 8 petals.  It is very peculiar that many flowers have the petals of the Fibonacci numbers, but the consistency of how often these numbers show up is important.

        Another way that his sequence shows up is in the human body. As humans, we have 1 thumb on each of our hands. In each 1 thumb, there are 2 bones, In each finger we have 3 bones, we have 5 digits on each hand, and 8 total fingers when the thumbs aren't counted (Parveen). This strange sequence could be considered a little bit odd and twisted to fit this example, but it's strange how the numbers of the Fibonacci Sequence show up in multiple circumstances.
