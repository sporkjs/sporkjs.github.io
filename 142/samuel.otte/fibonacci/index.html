        Leonardo Pisano was born in Italy in the year 1170. With a lot ahead of him in life, he lived 80 long years writing and discovering new information about the science of mathematics. Although, he is known mainly for the finding of the Fibonacci Sequence, he discovered much more than this. He wrote many books according to historians, 3 of which have been discovered.

        He grew up in the Bonacci family, where he had a father who was a treasured diplomat in North Africa. Instead of staying in Italy, he was educated in North Africa. While studying, he wrote about life and about mathematics. Living in the 12th century meant that he had no access to printmaking and could only copy his books if other people wanted a copy. His writings covered the decimal systems that were in place in the Hindu-Arabic world, the type of math that takes place throughout marketplaces, and also his world-famous Fibonacci sequence.

        Fibonacci was also nicknamed Bonello, as his name appears in a Census in the 1200â€™s. He spent a lot of his time writing and discussing his work to Frederick II of Rome. He dedicated one of his writings to the emperor. Although he contributed a lot to the art of mathematics with many different theories of numbers, a lot of his credit is overlooked. Many people know about the Fibonacci sequence, but not about his work with congruent numbers or numerals in the Hindu-Arabic number system. Although some of his work has gone missing, Fibonacci spent a great deal of work towards the mathematics of the world today.

        Fibonacci received his most famous nickname from people who misinterpreted the name of his book. Although is birth name was Leonardo Pisano, his fathers name was Guglielmo Bonaccio. When he published his first book, <i>Liber Abaci</i>, people misunderstood it as "filius Bonacci." When people read the term, they realized it sounded like Fibonacci. Hence, where his nickname came from.
