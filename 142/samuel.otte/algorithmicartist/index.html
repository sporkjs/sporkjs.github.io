        Vera Molnar, a Hungarian artist was born in 1924 on the 5th of January in Budapest. She grew up in a town called Vera Gacs. At the age of 93, she has composed a lot of different art generated by a computer. Many consider her to be one of the first Pioneers of Computer and Algorithmic Art.

        Vera was one of the first artists that focused on algorithms. Although there were many before her, she was one of the first to work on a computer screen. This was where she received the nickname of "The Pioneer of Computer Art."  She began to work towards her work in 1946, and has been working up until a few years ago. Her work is still available to people today.

        She found interest in art from a young age. She enjoyed geometry and the different shapes that were entailed. Computers became a useful tool to her as there was much more variation within the system than by pen and paper. Starting her artwork at a time where computers were still improving, Molnar learned more as well.

        Vera was one of the first algorithmic artists to begin working on computers. Especially with drawing, and ways to draw random abstract art upon a screen. She also founded two groups of Study that are present in Zurich, Helmhaus (Switzerland),  Parisian Institut d’Esthétique et des Science de l’Art (Paris Institute of Art).
