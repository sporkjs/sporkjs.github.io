        Curious at a young age, Molnar began to artistically work abstractly with geometry. A year later she moved to Rome where she lives now. When she was there, she gained access to a computer. It was in 1947 when she behan to develop her career and work towards being an algorithmic artist. She worked on those computers for the first few years to develop a system, but it wasn't until 1968 that she began drawing on computers.

        In 1968, she began working with geometrical shapes and themes. She really enjoyed working on a computer over hand drawings because there was so much more variation on the machine than on the machine of the brain. Over time, she worked in both media's, and eventually grew to be one of the first famous algorithmic artists of that time period. She has produced a large amount of drawings that are displayed in France, England, New York, and throughout Europe. Being from the Eastern part of the world, she has spent a lot of time there working on her paintings, drawings, collages, computer drawings, photography, and installations as well.
