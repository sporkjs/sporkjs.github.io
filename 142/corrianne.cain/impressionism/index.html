    <div id="content"><p>Here are five images that I created using different line functions. All of the images are photographs of things that I love and have shaped me.
</p> <img src=brownian.png><img src=cedarburg.jpg><p>This is a picture of my hometown, Cedarburg, Wisconsin made up of Brownian lines.</p><img src=noiseline2.png><img src=fil.jpg><p>Here is an image of my church, First Immanuel Lutheran, that was created out of noise lines, which are rather wavy.</p><img src=projectile.png><img src=costa.JPG><p>This image features Costa Rica, a country I visited and loved! I like how the projectile lines, made up of various angles, create a waviness and texture to the trees. This picture was taken near the Arenal volcano and features a beautiful Catholic church.</p><img src=hair.png><img src=flora.JPG><p>Here, you can see another picture from Costa Rica. The unique waviness of the hair function adds texture to the the beautfiul wall of flowers at a coffee plant.</p>
<img src=line.png><img src=cross.jpg><p>Finally, here is a cross made up of random lines. Though there is beauty in the colors of this painting, the chopiness of the lines reminds us of the brokenness of ourselves that led Jesus to the cross.</p>
