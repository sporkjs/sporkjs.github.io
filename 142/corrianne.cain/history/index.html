  <p> Blaise Pascal was born in 1623 in Clermont, France.  His mother died when he was 3 years old, which caused his father to move Blaise and his two sisters to Paris.  Etienne Pascal was a tax collector who believed Blaise should not be educated in mathematics until he reached the age of 15, despite Blaise's abilities that made him a child prodigy.  He desired for Blaise to become more well-rounded in the humanities, but Blaise was curious and decided to independently and secretly learn geometry at 12 years of age.  In fact, Blaise taught himself that the interior angles of a triangle have a sum of 180 degrees.  From then on, Etienne allowed Blaise to continue his studies in mathematics.</p>

  <p> Mersenne, a priest, philosopher, mathematician, and music theorist, held weekly meetings, the "Academie Libre"  discussing math and science in his cell.  Scholars, including Descartes and Desargues, all contributed.  Ã‰tienne allowed his son to join and Blaise was able to contribute his science and math discoveries. </p>

  <p>As Pascal matured, he showed aptitude in the areas of mathematics, physics, mechanics, and Christian philosophy.  However, due to lifelong health struggles, Pascal passed away at the age of 39.  Today, we recognize Pascal for a large number of theorems and inventions.</p>
