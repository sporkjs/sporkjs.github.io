  <p>In 1646, Pascal's father had an injury, and two religious brothers supported Blaise and his sisters.  This experience impacted Pascal's spiritual life tremendously.  Pascal then joined the Jansenist movement, a religious group that acknowledged the ideas of Calvin and Augustine, such as predestination and grace over works for salvation.</p>

  <p>In October of 1654, Pascal had a near-death experience involving his carriage's horses hanging over a bridge.  Pascal was rescued and again impacted spiritually.  Then, on November 23 of the same year, Pascal noted a vision of the crucifixion and from there, officially pledged his life to Christianity.</p>

  <p>Pascal wrote 18 essays in "Les Provinciales" which defended the Jansenist perspective while attacking the Jesuit ideas.  </p>

  <p>Following his death, Pascal's work Pensees was published.  He stated how science and reason alone cannot lead a person to God, but rather an experience. This work also includes Pascal's Wager, which argues that every man must risk believing in something because reason cannot be absolute certain.  He stated how one should gamble on the Christian faith because, as he said, "If you win, you win everything; if you lose, you lose nothing."</p>
