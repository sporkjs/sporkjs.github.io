<p>Pascal's science interests lay specifically in the field of physics and hydrodynamics.  He invented the hydraulic press and the syringe.  He performed Pascal's Barrel experiment, which exhibited that hydrostatic pressure is based on a difference in elevation, not the weight of a given fluid.  In addition, he did many experiments involving vacuums and air pressure.  Finally, he is known for Pascalâ€™s Law, which states that a pressure change occurring anywhere in a confined fluid is transmitted throughout all areas of the fluid.</p>
<p> Because of his work in the physics field, Pascal's name is used for a scientific unit.  The Pascal is an SI unit that represents one newton per square meter.  Its uses apply in the areas of internal pressure and stress, which Pascal studied through hydrostatics and hydrodynamics.</p>
