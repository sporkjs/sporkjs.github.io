theCaptions=[	"This work by MC Escher features hyperbolic geometry, where every vertex belongs to three triangles and three squares. "Circle Limit III" also features exponential growth in the fish.",
			"Leonardo da Vinci's "Vitruvian Man" reflects symmetry and proportion in the human body.",
			"This is another piece by MC Escher.  Though the math seems hidden, the work itself is a paradox, as the gallery is in the town, the town is in the picture, the picture is in the person's mind. A paradox or strange loop leads you to no conclusion.",
			"Dali's "Corpus Hypercubus," translated to crucifixion, resembles the attempt to model the divine perspective using four dimensions of the hypercube.",
			"These three works of da Vinci and Seurat feature phi, which is the Golden Ratio.",
			"This famous painting features the Fibonacci spiral, which is composed from the Golden Ratio between a sequence of numbers.",
			"Cubism is a technique that involves perspective, second, third, and fourth dimensions and involves a variety of shapes. This piece by Gris depicts Picasso, who was at the forefront of cubism.",
			"Architecture is a form of art that specifically involves math through measurement and proportions. The Parthenon also features the Fibonacci Sequence and the Golden Ratio.",
			"This work features the math of fractals and the Fibonacci sequence in binary form. Fractals repeat patterns at every scale",
			"This is a wall painting by Sol LeWitt that was generated as algorithmic art.",
			"TSP Art involves laying down dots and connecting them. Here, Andrew Warhol's classic piece is remade using this method.",
			"This ceiling design features rotational symmetry and numerous lines of reflections.",
			"Finally, MC Escher is famous for his tessellations, which feature repetitive geometry, vertices that line up, and no gaps or overlaps."
