<p>  Mohr's background in art and music is evident in his lyrical works. Here is how he describes his own work, "The computer became a physical and intellectual extension in the process of creating my art. I write computer algorithms i.e. rules that calculate and then generate the work which could not be realized in any other way. My artistic goal is reached when a finished work can dissociate itself from its logical content and stand convincingly as an independent abstract entity." </p> <p>Mathematical and algorithmic methods that can be seen in Mohr's work include graph theory, involving verticies, arcs, and lines; the divisibility and dissection of a cube; functions involving square roots; and 4D, 5D and 6D hypercubes, which are figures with four or more dimensions containing the forms of square and cubes.
