  <p>Manfred Mohr was born in Pforzheim, Germany on June 8, 1938. He originally started out as an action painter, working with gold and silver, and jazz musician, playing saxophone and oboe. After being inspired by Professor Max Bense's information aesthetics, he delved into the world of computer-generated art. He began the process in 1969. He started his work by applying algorthimic patterns of repetition to his previous drawings.<p> <p>Mohr can be considered a pioneer in the world of generative art. He won the Prix Aris Electronica award at a festival in Austria, and later went on to lead a seminar at the University of Vincennes. From there, he exhibited many solo shows around the world. His work can be found in the Centre Pompidou in Paris, the Ludwig Museum in Cologne, the Museum of Modern Art in New York, and in other musesums in Montreal, Amsterdam, Seoul, Paris, Berlin, and Zurich. Most recently, has won awards like the ACM SIGGRAPH Distinguished Artist Award for Lifetime Achievement in Digital Art in 2013.
