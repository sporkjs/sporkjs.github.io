			The full impact of Euler's massive influence on mathematics cannot be summed up quickly or simply, however, here are some of his most well-known contributions.
</p>
<p>
			Euler was the first to study the number "e", which equals approximately 2.718. Euler proved that "e" was irrational, meaning that it goes on forever without repeating, similarly to &pi;. The value of "e" is found in numerous mathematical formulas including those that describe nonlinear increases or decreases, and the statistical "bell curve". "e" is usually defined by this equation:

<p>
			Euler either created, popularized, or standardized much of the notation that mathematicians use today. These efforts in standardization helped to encourage collaboration and internationalize mathematics.
</p>
<p>
			Euler also calculated the values of the Riemann zeta function at even positive integers, the first of which provides a solution to the Basel problem.
