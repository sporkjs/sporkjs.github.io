<p>Poisson managed to publish anywhere between 300 and 400 math related works in total. Stunningly, this is the result of working on one topic at a time. </p>

<p>As a result of these high numbers Poisson had his name attached to many mathematical concepts, such as Poisson’s integral. Most notably of these is his contribution to probability theory, which first appeared in a published document in 1837. Eventually this contribution came to be known as Poisson Distribution. It is used for finding the likelihood of something happening a certain amount of times in a given amount of time. So if the rate of occurrence of an event is small, then the more likely you are to get near zero. So if the rate is higher the less likely you are to get zero.</p>

<p>For example if something happens around 5 times a day, but it isn’t guaranteed to always be  5, Poisson Distribution tells you how likely it for each number to occur over the course of however long. Compare this to if you had 50 of these events per day. You would be much less likely to have it happen zero times, but every other number gets just about as bad of chances of being picked (Thought the chances are not all the same). With 5 events you would be much more likely to get zero but also fairly likely to get 3 or 4.</p>

<p>It should be noted that this only works with whole numbers, with a known occurrence period, and with a known average frequency.</p>
