<p>Siméon Denis Poisson was born in Pithiviers, France in 1781. In the early years of his life he was educated by his family, who were probably a major influence on young Poisson and his future. After homeschooling was complete he went to a proper secondary school to the École Centrale in Fontainebleau. Though he had one been in Fontainebleau, reason being was because he had a surgeon uncle and his father thought it would be a good, secure career choice for him. This did not work. He flat out lacked the dexterity and drive to be a surgeon. Though with what he lacked he made up with a great potential in learning (mainly in mathematics).</p>
<p>Eventually he managed to be admitted to the École Polytechnique, but he was not without his struggles. He was quite underprepared for the social and academic setting and his lack of dexterity proved to still have its disadvantages. Despite this, he would eventually became the Associate Professor and he didn’t even have to take his final exam to manage this. He never did manage to get a spot in the Mathematics Section, as there were no spots available, but he did get the honor of being the the first Professor of Mechanics in the University of Paris’s new Faculty of Sciences.</p>
<p>He had pretty much gathered all possible honors and titles in the French academic system in one way or another. With this remarkable feat under his belt he was given supreme powers over the French universities, a power which he held alone for 25 years. With this power he could control any professor at any scientific university’s teaching program down to the details.</p>
