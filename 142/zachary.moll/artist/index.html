<b>"An architect doesn't go off with a shovel and dig his foundation and lay every brick. He's still an artist."</b>
</p>
<p>
Sol Lewitt is known for having a leading role in both the Conceptual and Minimalist movements. Lewitt falls into the category of algorithmic artist because he believed that "the idea itself could be the work of art, and maintained that, like an architect who creates a blueprint for a building and then turns the project over to a construction crew, an artist should be able to conceive of a work and then either delegate its actual production to others or perhaps even never make it at all."
