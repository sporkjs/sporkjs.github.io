        Sol Lewitt initially took up art as an act of rebellion against the industrial society he found himself. At college he was introduced to printmaking where he produced a print for the Tiffany Foundation that earned him $1000. With this money he was able to travel and study the masters. After he served in the Korean War, Lewitt eventually was hired by an architecture firm as a graphic designer. Through observing an architect's design process, Lewitt first began to build his philosophy on the role of an artist.

  Sol Lewitt went on to discover his most prominant style of art through another job working at a modern art museum. Lewitt's minimalist approach which stressed simplicity and clarity influenced a great number of artists, including Frank Stella, the father of minimalism. Lewitt's most prevalent movement was his Conceptual Movement that forever changed the way we look at an artist: as someone who simply creates the idea.
