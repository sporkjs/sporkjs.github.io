        "Imagine cutting the object into two non-overlapping parts, then similarly cutting these parts into parts, and so on until the process of repeated division is complete. Assuming the hypothetical division is 'exhaustive' or does comes to an end, then at the end we reach what Zeno calls 'the elements.'"

    In this theory the end result could be nothing, which means that the object is made of nothing which is impossible. The second result is that the objects are something but have no size, which means that the first object is built from things with no size which is impossible. The third result is that the objects are something and have measurable size, but that means that they are measurable and able to be further cut into parts. All three of the results lead to no real conclusion, therefore it is impossible to divide something into plurality.
