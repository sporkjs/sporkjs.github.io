Zeno of Elea is known for introducing the idea of “infinity” to mathematics. None of Zeno’s writings have survived through time, but he is continually referenced by Plato and Aristotle. Zeno is believed to be born around 490 B.C.E. in Elea, which is now Velia in Southern Italy; and he died around 430 B.C.E. Zeno was a friend and student of another scholar named Parmenides. It was in defense of Parmenides teachings that Zeno created his 40 paradoxes (only 10 are known today) that introduce the concept of “infinity.”

Although no scholars would agree with Zeno’s paradoxes today, he is credited with starting the discussion revolving around infinity and his paradoxes still make mathematical sense and mathematically confuse people to this day; this eventually leads to theories within Calculus that further expand upon Zeno’s paradoxes. This website will cover two main ideas of Zeno involving Paradoxes.
