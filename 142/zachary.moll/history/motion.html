        <b>The Achilles</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        “Achilles, whom we can assume is the fastest runner of antiquity, is racing to catch the tortoise that is slowly crawling away from him. Both are moving along a linear path at constant speeds. In order to catch the tortoise, Achilles will have to reach the place where the tortoise presently is. However, by the time Achilles gets there, the tortoise will have crawled to a new location. Achilles will then have to reach this new location. By the time Achilles reaches that location, the tortoise will have moved on to yet another location, and so on forever.”
      </p>
      <p>
        Zeno uses this paradox to argue that Achilles will never catch the tortoise. Achilles goes to an infinite number of places before he reaches the tortoise and the tortoise advances to an infinite number of places before being caught. This sequence of events that do not overlap in theory creates an infinity. Zeno claimed that anyone who believes that Achilles will catch the tortoise is believing the illusion of motion. This paradox was revolutionary at the time because it assumes that space and time are infinitely divisible even though there was no way for Zeno to properly describe it because the idea of “zero” did not exist.
