Stifel published a songbook in 1522 titled Von der christformingen Lehre Luthers ein uberaus schon kunstlich Lied samt seiner Nebenauslegung which portrayed Martin Luther as a sort of prophet, like an angel from Revelations sent to reveal the Antichrist. Stifel found refuge with a relative of Franz von Sickingen who protected many Reformers and Humanists in his homes. Unfortunately, the castle at Kronberg in the Taunus Mountains where Stifel fled to was taken by von Sickingen's enemies in October of 1522.

Stifel relocated to the town of Wittenburg where he met Martin Luther in person, who had moved there in March of 1522. Stifel lived within Luther's house and the two grew to be close friends. In 1528 Luther placed Stifel in a parish in Annaberg where, with free time abound, began exploring the possibilities of numerical predictions. After incorrectly predicting and warning the congregation of the end of the world at 8 a.m. on October 18, 1533, Stifel was arrested, put in jail, and dismissed as a pastor for inciting fear in his congregation, causing them to sell their possessions and give up their jobs. Luther was later able to release Stifel from prison. Stifel ceased making public announcements of religious predictions but still turned toward his abilities in mathematics.
