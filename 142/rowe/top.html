Across the top of the map is the top lane (go figure) where each team's best duelists fight it out. A top laner is typically a mix between tank and damage but this is possibly the most flexible lane as far as broadness of champion viability. This can include a secondary damage source to take down targets on the enemy team, initiation tanks to help in teamfight scenarios, supportive casters to buff and protect key members of your team, or fast fighters capable of providing map pressure by split pushing. Top laners also provide control over the Rift Herald jungle camp and don't assist the rest of their team until later in the game due to being the farthest away from the rest of the players.

<p>
Poppy is a close range fighter that specializes in bullying around other characters, dealing decent damage and preventing them from getting too far. Good in smaller skirmishes and longer teamfights.
</p>

		<img class="center" src="leagueImages/malphite.jpg">
<p>
Malphite is a heavy initiation tank that starts fights quickly and suddenly with a wide array of debuffing skills to pick off straglers. Difficult to deal with in a large group fight but not ideal for one on one duels.
</p>

		<img class="center" src="leagueImages/jax.jpg">
<p>
Jax is a heavy late game threat that deals massive damage very quickly. He's fast, agile, and excels in one on one combat. His split push capability is one of the fastest in the game.
