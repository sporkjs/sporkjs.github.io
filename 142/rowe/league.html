Welcome to League of Legends, a Multiplayer Online Battle Arena (MOBA) computer game where two teams of five battle it out to try and destroy the opposing team's base. Among these five players are five distinct roles each member must fill in order for their team to succeed. Deciding which role you will play is the first and most difficult choice you will make.
