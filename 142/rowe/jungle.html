In between the three lanes is a maze-like zone known as the jungle. Within this zone is where your team's jungler lives and controls. Their job is managing and securing the neutral objectives as well as provide support on the map wherever your team needs it. This includes distributing buffs to key members of your team and maintaining control over the Dragon and Baron camps. Securing these netral objects is primarily done with the summoner spell "Smite". This deals an amount of true damage based on your level. Junglers are able to provide your team with a tank or secondary damage source depending on what your team is lacking. Some kind of sustain is required for junglers to succesfully clear jungle camps early on in the game.

Warwick renerates health with every attack, making him one of the best characters for sustain in the jungle. His primary focus is clearing camps within the jungle until he becomes a ravenous monster that hunts down and eliminates high priority targets.

Sejuani is a crowd control heavy tank with devastating initiation. Players who pick her are always looking to start a fight and secure kills for their team early on in the game.

Kindred are two separate spirits forming one mobile ranged champion that hunts down different targets over the course of the game, be it enemy players or jungle monsters, becoming a large damage threat for your team.
