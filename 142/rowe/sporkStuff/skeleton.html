	Teemo is what's called a Yordle (kind of a mix between a squirel and a racoon) and is the greatest, cutest, most hardcore videogame character that has ever existed. Coming in at a solid two feet tall, Teemo takes on the biggest and strongest champions in the land with only a blowgun and his dreams. And landmines I guess.
