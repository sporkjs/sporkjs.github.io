        When it came to math Siméon-Denis Poisson focused on the work of pure mathematics which includes definite integrals and electromagnetic theory, as well as the idea of probability. One could define pure mathematics as developing and study of mathematic principles for one’s own sake; this is instead of using them immediately. A few examples of other branches one could study in this area would be arithmetic, geometry, and analysis situs, topology. He also has named a distribution process after himself; it is named the Poisson distribution. This is where one can describe the number of times one might win in gambling, one of the rarest games to win.

        The Poisson distribution can later be seen used in WWII when trying to analyze how many times a flying bomb would hit the intended target. This was used to determine if the Germans were targeting or hitting by chance. The above image shows the formula that was used in to calculate the Poisson distribution, as well as a graph showing the results of using the formula. Because of the work, and the papers written and published by Poisson, a few German mathematicians like Peter Dirichlet and Bernhard Riemann where able to purse work like his. Poisson paved the way for them.
