        <img class="smallRight" src="images/Poisson.jpg"> Siméon-Denis was born June 21, 1781 in France. As he grew up his family wanted to and pushed him to be a doctor, they even sent him to stay with his uncle and start school as a doctor, however he had no interest and made little progress in this field. He instead became a mathematician. Poisson was sent to École Centrale of Fontainebleau for schooling. At École Centrale of Fontainebleau Poison had a great teacher who eventually was learning from Poisson, and pushing himself so that he could be at the higher level of mathematics that Poisson was at. To many of his fellow peers he was like a professor because they came to him for help explaining difficult material and lectures.

        Siméon-Denis, for most of his schooling was free to do what he wanted, and two years after moving forward and attending school at École Polytechnique at Paris, in 1802, Siméon-Denis had already published two essays, one about methods of elimination and the other on integrals of an equation of finite differences and was already a professor at the university. These were published in the Recueil des savants érangers, one of the well know publications, that gave him honor and credit in the field of math and science. These publications also pushed the way for Siméon-Denis to enter into the science field in 1808. The next year he was also made a professor in the science institution.

      As the years continued he remained professeur de la mécanique rationelle and then later became an examiner at the military school. However by July 1830, the revolution threatened his honor in the science and math fields of work. As the years continued he became a peer of France instead, but they say the reason was to represent French science. He was still teaching mathematics and continued to be successful in this field. In this field he was able to publish over three hundred works. Then sadly he passed away in April of 1840.
