          <img class="smallRight" src="Images/creature.png"> Kerry uses a lot of different tecniques when she creates her works, some of these include paint (as seem to the right)or photographs, but a lot of them are done graphically with the idea of both math and art concepts being used. This means she uses technology a lot in her works. One can see this especially in the fact that there are multiple sites that have her work included. Some including her own blog kerrymitchell.com, her twitter account which is twitter.com/kerrycmitchell or kerrymitchellart.com which includes files that show how she went about completing specific looks or features to her pieces.

  <img class="smallLeft" src="tree.png">  When it comes to the work done on the computer she uses her iPad and iPhone. Which a good example of her using her iPhone can be seen in the picture to the lower left. She took this picture while on a walk along the beach. She uses many apps to complete the edits done to some of the picture, apps like Corel, Procreate, and many more. One of the interesting things to not about this artist is that she has never used blue in any of her pieces, except for when it is already included in the photograph. She also does 3D work but all is her own work.
