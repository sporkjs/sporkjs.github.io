        <img class="smallRight" src="Images/kerrymichelle.jpg"> Kerry Mitchell is a very different artist, one many might not be able to relate to but one who really brings interest to the mind. Creating her works with photography, computer apps, and still others done in paint. She is from Seattle Washington, who was born April 11, 1950.

      The most interesting and a very important fact about her to mention is that she was diagnosed with both Fibromyalgia and Lyme Disease a few years ago. However these disease when undiagnosed for 15 years and she became so sick she couldn't even get out of bed. This is the time that she really started working with photography and creating her works on the computer. She didn't let these diseases stop her from creating her art. She is now doing much better and is really enjoying her life, still creating her art, but getting out there more to see the world with her husband. They enjoy hiking and on these hikes is when she takes her images to work with.

  One of the best places to veiw lots of her work is www.myfolio.com/KerryCMitchell#media. It is seperated into series but a lot of her graphicaly done images are there. She is a great insperation for graphic designers, becasue even with computer practice makes new for art. She also shows that no matter what learning new techniques is not impossible for anyone.
