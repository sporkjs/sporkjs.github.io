Charles Howard Hinton was a phenomenal mathematician, born in England in 1853.
He earned both a Bachelor's and Master's degree from Oxford University.  Hinton
then went on to teach at Cheltenham Ladie's School, Uppington School, Princeton
University, and even at a school in Japan. He married Mary Everest Boole,
daughter of famous mathematician George Boole.

Hinton studied a variety of subjects, becoming somewhat of a "jack of all trades".
However, he was most interested in the science of dimensions, and the possibility
of a fourth dimension.  While some of his theories have been debunked, they were
crucial building blocks to future dimensional research.
