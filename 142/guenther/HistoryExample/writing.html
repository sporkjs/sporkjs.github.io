Hinton made a wide variety of speculations about the Fourth Dimension, and
published them in books such as <i>A New Era of Thought</i> and
<i>The Fourth Dimension</i>.He referred to these novels as "Scientific Romances".
Essentially, his writing revolved around explaining his dimensional concepts
through creative, science-fiction narratives.

For example, Hinton speculated that two additional directions exist in the
fourth dimension: "kata" (Greek "down from") and "ana" (Greek "up toward").  If
a person wants to view the fourth dimension, Hinton claims they must study his
colored cubes (pictured below).  However, these ideas were rejected by many
scientists and mathematicians, one of which claimed thinking about the cubes
could make you insane.  Yet one can agree that the cubes are extremely
well-recorded and designed.

	Truly, Charles Howard Hinton's writing-oriented mind assisted in the
	preservation, and perhaps intrigue, of his theories.
