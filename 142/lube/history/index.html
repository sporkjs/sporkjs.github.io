	Sophie Germain was a French mathematician famous for her work with elasticity and numbers theory. She is also famous, probably moreso, for being an influential female mathematician during a period in history where women were not allowed the same academic privelages and standing as their male counterparts.
</p>
<p>
	Germain was born in 1776 in Paris, France and grew up amidst the French Revolution. Her family was wealthy, with her father being the director of the Bank of France, and owned a library of their own. During the revolt, young Sophie would not be allowed outside the house, and would therefore hide away in the library and read books pertaining to her interests. When her parents found out that she was studying math and science, they were very discouraging of it, but eventually came to after Sophie's relentless attempts to educate herself.
</p>
<p>
	She hid her gender behind the pseudonym M. Le Blanc, and was able to gain access to lecture notes of courses from contemporary scholars in Paris. This is how she met the famous mathematician Joseph-Louis Larange, who strongly supported her work.
<p>
	In 1816 she won first prize in a contest about vibration of elastic surfaces held by the French Academy of Sciences. This fit her into the prominent group of mathematicians at the time. Although she was a collaborator among the group, she was unable to increase her contributions much further. Many believe it was because she lacked a formal education.
</p>
<p>
	Even so, Sophie Germain was a well-known figure in not only mathematical history, but social and political history as well. Her persistence and passion drove her to a place where many women during her time did not go. She is a great role model for women and mathematicians everywhere.
