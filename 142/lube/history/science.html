<p>
Sophie Germain contributed to the French Academy of Sciences with her memoir about Ernst F.F. Chladni's experiments with vibrating plates. She submitted a memoir three times, and finally in 1816, her findings were accepted and rewarded.
</p>
<p>
Germain was the first woman to win a prize from the Academy.
</p>
<p>
For seven years following her recognition, she was allowed to attend classes at the Academy as well. Although there is not much else on her contribution to science or elasticity, it is an incredible feat for a woman of that time to attend higher education.
