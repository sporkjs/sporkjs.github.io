     <i>"Mathematics is the door and the key to the sciences."</i>

    <p>Roger Bacon was born roughly around 1214, although there is some debate surrounding this, and lived a life in pursuit of scientific truths in correlation with his study of math until his death in 1292.
</p>
  <p>  As an accomplished Oxford man, born from a farm family, he traded his scythe for the sciences. After spending many years learning Latin and studying Aristotle, Bacon became teacher at Oxford, and eventually in Paris, and back to Oxford. Although he spent a lot of time teaching, Bacon was also devoted to his own studies and research. Bacon based a lot of his teachings on that of Aristotle and is often credited as one of the founders of the modern day scientific method. Many scholars, are actually very impressed by how similar some of Bacon’s writings and proposals are to modern day standards.
</p>
    <p>Like many scholars and visionaries of the time, throughout Bacon's scientific journey he faced hardships with the church's approval. Fortunately, Bacon developed a relationship with Pope Clement IV and had his support due to Bacon’s belief that science helped man understand God. In his lifetime, Bacon gained a lot of success as a teacher, but also contributed to many sciences and mathematics, notably using geometry in optics.
